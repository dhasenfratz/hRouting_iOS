The Health-Optimal Route Planner
------------

The Health-Optimal Route Planner lets you choose the healthiest path between any two given locations in the city of Zurich, Switzerland.
Using high-resolution air pollution maps, the app computes the shortest path between two locations and a healthier alternative, which reduces the exposure to air pollutants.
Further, it provides information about the route lengths and the expected exposure reduction.
Perfect for pedestrians, cyclists, and urban dwellers.
